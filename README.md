# Smart Contract Based-Legal Consensus using Blockchain

## 📌 Project Overview
"Decentralized Legal Consensus using Blockchain" is a blockchain-based system that enables transparent, trustless, and secure legal consensus mechanisms. It leverages **smart contracts** and **decentralized governance** to facilitate legal agreements, dispute resolution, and contract enforcement.

## 🔥 Features
- **Decentralized Governance** – Enables trustless legal decision-making.
- **Smart Contracts** – Automates and enforces agreements securely.
- **Immutable Ledger** – Ensures transparency and tamper-proof records.
- **Consensus Mechanism** – Replaces traditional authority with distributed trust.
- **Secure Identity Management** – Uses cryptographic methods for authentication.

## 🚀 Technologies Used
- **Blockchain** (Ethereum/Solidity)
- **Smart Contracts** (Solidity)
- **Web3.js** (for blockchain interaction)
- **Ganache** (for decentralized storage)

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup
1. **Clone the Repository**
```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Decentralized-Legal-Consensus.git
   cd Decentralized-Legal-Consensus'
```
2.	**Install Dependencies**
```sh
    npm install
```
3. **Install Truffle & Ganache**
```sh
    npm install -g truffle
    install ganache locally on your system from oficial website and import the truffle-config.js and create a new worksapce with name 'development'
```
4. **Compile & Deploy the Smart Contracts**
```sh
    truffle compile
    truffle migrate --network development
    truffle test //for testing purpose
```
5. **Working**
```sh
    truffle console
    Use the codes in 'how to run the code.txt' to interact with the smart contract
```
